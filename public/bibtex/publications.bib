Dynamical models under consideration are described by ordinary differential equations involving a switching mechanism and in the presence of bounded uncertainties. The design procedure we analyse is based on the newly elaborated attractive ellipsoids method ([33]). The stability and robustness of the resulting closed-loop system involves an abstract Clarke stability theorem. A short discussion on the obtained analytic results and possible applications and extensions is also included.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of robust control for a class of nonlinear dynamical systems in the continuous time domain. We deal with nonlinear models described by differential algebraic equations (DAEs) in the presence of bounded uncertainties. The full model of the control system under consideration is completed by linear sampling-type outputs. Main contribution of present manuscript is the proposal of a linear state feedback control design for this type of uncertain nonlinear system obtaining the required stability and robustness. Due to the need to the state feedback there is a need of the implementation of a Luenberguer observer. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is illustrated by a computational example. A brief discussion on the main implementation issue is also included.},

  abstract = {In a factory, final product needs to be thoroughly inspected before delivering to customer. This is achieved by factory floor tester. Factory floor tester is responsible for automation of testing final product's completeness, assembly exactness and correct functionality. The project deals with design of the factory floor tester. This includes the hardware design, software design, integration of software with fabricated hardware and testing the whole setup. Hardware design includes the design of electronic circuit and simulation. Software design is development of a GUI interface to the designed hardware. This includes the coding in embedded C, embedded C++ and Visual C++. The software code and other data is dumped in the fabricated unit's memory, the unit is allowed to interface with the PC for the GUI module to take control over it. The final phase is to test and debug the software to assure the proper integration between both software and hardware setup.

  The advancement of virtual instrument allows us to perform more complex testing operations. This project also deals with developing an test equipment which is responsible of testing complex functionalities like GSM communication (multi threading operations), handling multiple grounds effectively (implementing complex algorithms), connecting database and making database available for analysis (manipulating database over network).

  Identifying the System transfer function gives the detail information of the system. In this project we have attempted to automate the process of identifying the transfer function of an electrical system.},

  abstract  = {In this paper a one degree of freedom (DOF) force augmenting device (FAD) is presented. A laboratory set-up has been built and some tests of the interaction between the FAD and a user were performed. The stability of the closed loop system is essential for the performance of the FAD. The FAD by itself is a stable device, but what is important is to assure the stability of the interaction between the FAD and a human being. To deal with this matter, two situations were analyzed. The case of no delays in the model is first considered. This situation might appear unrealistic, for this reason, a second analysis is performed considering a human model with delays. In order to deal with delays a Rekasius substitution is used. To perform the stability analysis, it is sufficient to apply the Routh-Hurtwitz criteria. Attempts with other techniques have given more conservative stability results. The stability has been proven for delays smaller than upper-bounds which have been computed. None of these upper-bounds are reached by any healthy human being. Therefore, we can assure that the whole system is stable for most of the practical situations. This proves the robustness of the closed loop system with respect to delays. In real time experiments, measurement from the sensors are normally noisy. In order to reduce the effect of the noise, a low pass filter was included. The introduction of this filter alters the order of the system, changing the stability conditions of the whole set up. So the stability analysis is performed again with the inclusion of the filter.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents a one degree of freedom (DOF) linear force augmenting device (FAD), a human arm (HA) model, a model of the FAD-HA interaction, a stability analysis for the system resulting from the FAD-HA interaction, and finally numerical simulations and experimental results.

  The FAD consists of an electrical motor and a ball-screw mechanism that converts the torque generated by the electric motor to a force that moves a load. A force sensor is attached to the load to capture the force applied by the human operator to the FAD.

  The control algorithm presented in this thesis allows the user to feel part of the load all the time, even at the rest position.

  A linear model for the HA is employed to study the stability of the FAD-HA interaction. As a depart from past works, this work presents a stability analysis considering time-delays in the human model. A key ingredient in the analysis is the use of the Rekasius substitution for replacing the time-delay terms. It is proved that the FAD-HA interaction is stable when the human model has no delays. When delays are considered in the human model, the analysis performed provides upper bounds for the time-delays below which a stable interaction is assured.

  Numerical simulations are presented, which allow assessing the FAD-HA interaction. Experimentation is performed with a laboratory prototype with which several human operators lift a load. It is observed that the FAD-HA interaction is stable and that the human operator is able to lift the load to its desired position by experiencing an effort that can always be controlled.},
